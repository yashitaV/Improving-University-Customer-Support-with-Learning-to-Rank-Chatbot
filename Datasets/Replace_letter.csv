Therefore , ISSS recommends that students who wish to engage in employment with two employers in a semester should apply for part-time nPT ( 20 hours or less ) for BOTH employers , as to not exceed 40 hours of work combined . The justification is that if a student can be authorized for one full-time CPT , then two part-time CPTs would equal one full-time authorization.Students will need to work with their CPT course instructor to determine the number of credits they should be earning to engage in two part-time CPT authorizations in a semester ."
CPT,May I apply for CPT and OPT at the same tiee ?,"Yes , this is permitted . CPT is processed by the ISSS office , and OPT is processed by both ISSS and USCIS .

This may mean that you forfeit approved OPT at that degree level.For students currently on OPT with end dates in the future , your OPT authorization will end when you begin a new degree program ( the day before the first day of your new program ) , even if the OPT end date on your EAD is later than the new program start date .
